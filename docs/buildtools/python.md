# Build tools: Python

Install Python and pip on Alpine with `sudo apk add python3 py3-pip`. You can now run it with `python3` and Control+D quits again.

We are going to practice installing the [mistletoe](https://github.com/miyuchina/mistletoe) module, which renders markdown into HTML.

  - In python, try the line `import mistletoe` and notice that you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mistletoe'`. 
  - Quit python again and try `sudo pip3 install mistletoe`. You should get a success message (and possibly a warning, explained below).
  - Open python again and repeat `import mistletoe`. This produces no output, so the module was loaded.

Create a small sample markdown file as follows, called `hello.md` for example:

    # Markdown Example

    Markdown is a *markup* language.

Open python again and type the following. You need to indent the last line (four spaces is usual) and press ENTER twice at the end.

    import mistletoe
    with open('hello.md', 'r') as file:
        mistletoe.markdown(file)

This should print the markdown rendered to HTML, e.g.

    <h1>Markdown Example</h1>\n<p>Markdown is a <em>markup</em> language.</p>

<p>Python version 3 came out in 2008 and has some syntax changes compared to Python 2; version 2 is now considered deprecated. On most systems, you simply use 'python' and 'pip' for the version 3 commands. Alpine is a bit of an exception here as it still calls the commands 'python3' and 'pip3', in case you are still using programs that require version 2.</p>
<p>When a language comes with its own package manager, sometimes you have a choice between using the OS package manager (e.g. apk) and the language one (e.g. pip) to install modules. Generally speaking, the language one will contain the most up-to-date versions and you should use that unless you have a reason to do otherwise.</p>
<p>At the time of writing for example, the Alpine repos contain pip version 19, but the python distribution itself contains version 21, so you get a warning when you are using the older one - complete with the command you should type to install the newer one, except that on Alpine you actually have to type <code class="language-plaintext">sudo pip3 install --upgrade pip</code>.</p>
<p>
You can in fact use pip without sudo, by passing the <code>--user</code> option which installs packages into a folder in your home directory (<code>~/.local</code>) instead of in /usr which requires root permissions. It is a matter of choice which one to use, except if you are on a machine without root rights (like a lab machine) where you have to use the user install option.

## Scipy

In Maths B, we will be using `scipy` for statistics, so you may as well install that too. Unfortunately, `pip` will not help you here because scipy depends on a C library for fast linear algebra, and this doesn't exist for Alpine linux in the `pip` repositories. It does exist in the Alpine repos though, so `sudo apk add py3-scipy` will install it.

The following commands show if it is correctly installed, by sampling 5 times from a Normal distribution with mean 200 and standard deviation 10:

    from scipy.stats import norm
    norm(loc=200, scale=10).rvs(5)

This should print an array of five values that are not too far off 200 (to be precise, with about 95% confidence they will be between 180 and 220 - more on this in Maths B later on).

You might want to install python and scipy on your host OS as well, as it's a really easy language to code in and you can use your favourite editor and even make graphical plots - you will probably learn about this in second year, and maybe again in third year if you take Machine Learning. In this case, if your host OS is Windows or Mac, I recommend that you install the [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution (obviously the Python 3 version, not the Python 2 one) so that you can easily install scipy. This gets you two package managers: `conda install scipy` uses the conda one (which can handle the required C library) and `pip` for everything else. For Linux, you can install conda too, or just use the scipy packaged with your distribution.
