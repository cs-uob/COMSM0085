# Unit Contents and Learning Outcomes

COMSM0085 builds on your knowledge of imperative and object-oriented programming.

The aim of this unit is that by the end of the unit _you will be ready to write
your first data-backed web application_. That is, you will be able to produce a
program with a web-based user interface, which is backed by a server that lets
you interact with some data in a database. This is the "bread and butter" of
many software developer jobs and a skill with which you can deliver a lot of
value for clients. 

The topics we will cover in this unit are:

  - *Basic system administration.* This includes POSIX, Linux, and the command line. Using
    Alpine linux, a minimalist system, you will learn everything from effective
    use of the command line (including scripting) to installing packages and
    setting up and securely connecting to virtual machines.
  - *Version control with git.* This tool is standard enough in industry nowadays
    that you can be expected to know about it in a technical interview.
  - *The developer's toolkit.* Debugging, testing, and automating the build
    process of your software.
  - *Databases.* You will learn the SQL programming language and how to interact
    with a database both from the command line and from another application. You
    will also learn about how to intelligently organise your database into
    tables.
  - *Basics of the web.* HTML and CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.
  - *Server side.* HTTP, servers, request lifecycles and related topics.
  - The *React* web application/user interface library.

In 2000, Joel Spolsky wrote an article called [The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better
Code](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/).
Joel's portfolio includes developing Stack Overflow (the website), Trello and
Microsoft Excel so he knows what he's talking about. (Since it was written in
2000 before git took over the world, it's not mentioned yet, but _version
control_ is point number one.) Software Tools will help you to become a
programmer who can do your bit to make your team pass the technical parts of the
Joel test.

MIT has a page called [the missing semester of your CS
education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/). This is a course containing all
those things that you're expected to know by the end of your CS degree, but are
often not taught explicitly - you're expected to pick them up by your own on the
side (hence the "missing" semester). Software Tools covers very similar content:
the unit was born out of the idea "we expect our students to know this, some of
them don't, what if we actually teach it?".

Valley tech bloggers, lots of posts about development and bugs and security and
corporate culture and posix and stuff.
