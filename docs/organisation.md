# Unit Organisation

## Timetable

We will be meeting every Friday 10am--1pm in Computer Lab 2.11, Merchant
Venturers Building.

This applies all weeks except Week 18 (reading week). In Week 24, we still have
the lab booked but there is no new material (revision week), we'll just hold a
drop-in. 

During these booked hours you may ask anyone not taking this unit to leave the
room if you need a seat/computer.

The unit will have a Teams page, where we hold parallel online sessions for the
workshops for anyone not in Bristol, self-isolating, or who does not want to
come to the in-person ones. 

Teams will also be the place to ask questions about the unit. *Please do not
e-mail us*; if you ask on Teams then we can reply once, and everyone else can
benefit from the answer.


## Materials

The unit materials for [part 1](exercises/part1) are stable in the sense that there should be at most minor bug fixes. The schedule of workshops is therefore:

| Week | Tuesday | Thursday |
|------|---------|----------|
| 13   | Posix 1 | Posix 2  |
| 14   | Posix 3 | Posix 4  |
| 15   | Build Tools 1 | Build Tools 2 |
| 16   | Databases 1 | Databases 2 |
| 17   | Databases 3 | Databases 4 |

These correspond to activities 1-10 on the [part 1 exercises](exercises/part1) page.

The first page for each activity contains links to the videos, slides, or readings for the activity that you are expected to watch or read before coming to the workshop. Some workshop exercises involve group work where there is a good reason for it, for example to practice working as a team with a git repository.

One of the most common pieces of student feedback since the start of the pandemic was that students would like videos or other materials out one week before they need to be used in a lab. We will try and implement this as far as possible for this unit: the materials for part 1 are all available from the start of term, and each video comes with its length listed in a table so you can better plan when you are going to watch them. This preparation also means the unit should be able to continue to run even if staff and most TAs are unwell one week - in this case you might miss out on some support but you will still be able to continue working independently.

The materials for part 2 are still in a draft stage and not all complete yet. You can have a peek by changing "part1" to "part2" in the link above, but assume that they may change before they get released.

## Coronavirus

We will hold our workshops in person, pandemic-permitting.

**Please wear a mask at all times in the lab. SARS-CoV-2 spreads through
[sharing air](https://www.mpg.de/17916867/coronavirus-masks-risk-protection).**


## Assessment
