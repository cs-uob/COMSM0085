# Unit Organisation

We will hold workshops on Fridays, 10am-1pm.

This unit will run in a **hybrid form**. This means that you can attend either in-person, or online---or both!

That is to say, for each workshop:
* You may come in and work on lab computers; we will be in the [Merchant Venturers Building](https://goo.gl/maps/zJV2YH6k28G36TEp8), Computer Lab 2.11.
* You may attend online through Teams, and log into lab computers remotely.

The reason is to accommodate amongst others the following circumstances:
* students who cannot physically be in Bristol
* students self-isolating
* students who do not want to be taught in-person

## In-person sessions

During the aforementioned hours you may ask anyone not taking this unit to leave
the room if you need a seat/computer.

**Pending further instructions, please wear a mask at all times in the lab.**

The virus that causes COVID-19, i.e. SARS-CoV-2, spreads very efficiently through [sharing air](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/coronavirus-disease-covid-19-how-is-it-transmitted). This is to say that breathing in the same room as someone else without masks and efficient ventilation will transmit the virus with overwhelming probability. Thankfully, good quality masks [prevent infection](https://www.mpg.de/17916867/coronavirus-masks-risk-protection).

Please **do not come to the in-person sessions if you are experiencing [any of the following symptoms](https://joinzoe.com/learn/omicron-symptoms)**:
- fatigue (even a little)
- sore throat (even a tickle)
- cough (even a little)
- headache
- runny nose
- sneezing
- fever
- loss of sense of smell or taste

If you have even extremely mild symptoms, it is common courtesy to assume you have COVID-19. If you bring it into the lab you will cause disruption with mathematical certainty. Please isolate until your symptoms go away.

We will make sure self-isolating students are supported.
## Online support through Teams

The unit may be running in-person, but **we recommend that you use Teams to ask questions**. There are multiple benefits to this practice:

1. You can obtain a better thought-out, written answer.
2. Other students who have the same question (they always do) will benefit from seeing the answer.
3. You will be able to refer to your question and the answer when revising (if only to remember how hard it was the first time).

The lecturers and TAs will of course answer questions in-person, but may ask you to repeat your question on Teams. If you do not wish to do, they might post it anonymously, along with the answer.

## How to learn in this unit

This unit comes with
* lectures, and
* activities.

**You are expected to watch the lectures and read the activities before each workshop.** This takes time, so we recommend that you start early.

The first page for each activity contains links to videos and readings for the activity that you are expected to watch or read _before coming to the workshop_.

Some activities involve group work where there is a good reason for it, for example to practice working as a team with a git repository.

Please come to the workshops with questions. It goes without saying that:
* there are no silly questions
* we are here to help you move forward if you've gotten stuck in one part of the activity

If you have not finished the activities by the end of the workshop, you are expected to complete them in your own time.

All the material for Part 1 is already online. This is in order to be resilient in case the lecturers and TAs are unwell. You are expected to stick to the schedule given below even if all the staff have taken ill.

## Schedule

The schedule for [part 1](exercises/part1) of the unit is as follows:

| Week | Activities         |
|------|--------------------|
| 13   | POSIX 1 & 2        |
| 14   | POSIX 3 & Git      |
| 15   | Build Tools 1 & 2  |
| 16   | Databases 1 & 2    |
| 17   | Databases 3 & 4    | 

(NB Week 13 is the week beginning on Monday 24 January 2022.)

These correspond to activities 1-10 on the [part 1 exercises](exercises/part1) page.

Week 18 is reading week, so there will be no workshops that week.

The materials for part 2 are still in a draft stage and not all complete yet. You can have a peek by changing "part1" to "part2" in the link above, but assume that they may change before they get released.

## Assessment

More details will be added here in due time.
