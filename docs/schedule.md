# Schedule

This unit's contact time is made up of two workshops per week:

  * Tuesdays, 9am-11am.
  * Fridays, 11am-1pm.

The workshops will take place online in Microsoft Teams. If you are a student on this unit, the Team for this unit will appear when you log in to Teams with your university account, either on the desktop client or on [https://teams.microsoft.com/](https://teams.microsoft.com/).

Attending the workshops in teaching weeks (see below) is mandatory, TAs take attendance, and you need to be present in 75% of the workshops to meet the hurdle for this unit.

# Topics and Weeks

In weeks 13 and 14, you will learn the basics of Linux/POSIX system administration, the shell, and git. We will use a custom virtual machine with the Alpine linux distribution for this, which you can either run on your own machine or you can log in to a lab machine via ssh and run it there. As Alpine is text/terminal only, no graphical user interface, it should work even over a slow connection.

In week 15, you will learn about build systems and environments in different programming languages, and how to use a debugger.

In week 16, we will hold a catch-up/Q&A week: the workshops will take place but will not be mandatory and will not count towards your attendance. Apart from functioning as a Q&A session, this week will give us lecturers a chance to talk about interesting questions we have been asked by students in previous weeks in more depth, and to possibly prepare some extra explanations based on how the unit has been going so far.

Week 17 is reading week. There will be no material and no workshops.

In weeks 18 and 19, you will learn about databases using the MariaDB fork of the popular MySQL database. By the end of week 19 you will have learnt enough Java in the parallel unit that you will be able to understand how to operate a database from a Java program.

In weeks 20 and 21, you will learn about web technologies, starting with a crash course in HTML/CSS and working up to the point that you can write a web-based application. We will look at some of the many technologies and frameworks along the way, aligned with the ones that the lecturers on the Software Engineering Project next year will expect you to use.

Between weeks 20 and 21, there is a three-week break for Easter.

In weeks 22 and 23, you will learn about the cloud, with lectures provided by our resident cloud experts. These will not just be useful for your 2nd year software project, but also if you choose to take the Cloud Computing and Big Data (COMSM0072) in your final year.

Week 24 is revision week. There will be drop-ins instead of workshops; these are neither mandatory nor do they count towards your attendance hurdle. There will be no new material.
