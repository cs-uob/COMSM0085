Stack Calculator Documentation

This program implements a simple RPN/stack calculator. You can use the digits 0-9 and the
four operators "+-*/". You can use spaces between numbers and operators, and you must use
spaces to separate numbers e.g. "12" is the number 12 but "1 2" is the number 1 followed
by the number 2. The strings "1 2+" and "1 2 +" and any variation on these that adds more
spaces have exactly the same effect.

The program reads tokens (numbers or operators) from left to right and
  - for every number read, pushes it onto the stack
  - for every operator read, pops two values off the stack, operates on them and pushes
    the result back on the stack.
An expression is valid if, at the end of evaluating, there is exactly one value on the
stack and there was never an operator encountered while there were fewer than two values
on the stack.

Terminate the program by closing standard input (e.g. Control+D on a fresh line on the
terminal.)

Compile with "-l readline". You might need to "sudo apt-get install libreadline-dev" first.

For example,

"1 2 +" -> 3.0000 (all output and calcuations are done on doubles).
"1 2 + 4 *" -> 12.0000 (this is (1+2)*4, note how RPN never needs brackets).
"1" -> 1.0000 (a number on its own just evaluates to itself).
"01" -> 1.0000 (leading zeroes are ignored).

Errors

If the stack limit of 10 is exceeded, you get "Error, stack full".

"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1" -> Error

If you put an operator when there are fewer than two values on the stack, you get the
message "Error, operator on empty stack."

"+ 1" -> Error
"1 + 1" -> Error
"1 1 +" -> 2.0000 (not an error)
"1 +" -> Error
"1 2 + 3 -" -> 0.0000 (not an error)
"1 2 + - 3" -> Error (the minus appears when there is only one value on the stack)

Any character other than the ones specified above is an error. Note that we don't
need to handle newlines, because readline() strips them for us, and we stop on
reaching the end of the string.

If there is no value or more than one value on the stack at the end of the line,
you get "Error, expected exactly one value but got #." where # is the number of
values on the stack at the end.

"" -> Error
"1 2" -> Error
"1" -> 1.0000 (not an error, although not particularly insightful either)
"1 2 + 3" -> Error

Division by zero produces an inf or -inf double value, inf/inf or 0/0 produces NaN.
These are not errors as far as the program is concerned.
