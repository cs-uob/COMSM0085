# System Administration

## Videos

Before this activity, you should watch the following videos - most of them are quite short. The videos are hosted on Microsoft Stream, and you will need to authenticate via university log-in to watch them.

| Video | Length | Slides |
|-------|-------:|--------|
| [SSH](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/d2736b4b-80de-4740-9084-2ab458a9dbab) | 10 minutes | [slides](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/me17847_bristol_ac_uk/ERXOIS-oCUxMmOguGB0ctO8BSWKpCskLDBmWM3c6wrk90A?e=IobhBb) |
| [Vagrant](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/373abf95-52ce-45d2-82d0-28250d300184) | 12 minutes | [slides](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/me17847_bristol_ac_uk/EW4-UCx2St1Gl8AGPwTuq4EBhNt7-KfnKhbewow6w3WuJQ?e=bJeh4g) |
| [Package managers](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/9091bdf6-2242-4b43-b09e-9641f9401135) | 6 minutes | [slides](https://uob-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/me17847_bristol_ac_uk/EUPLvl82HzRGi-nyhSdiBicBb7EBnouRVnT6RAKKyzhqKQ?e=Ow5cmt) |

_NB: The videos were recorded last year. Almost everything still applies, but you might see us talking about 'Alpine' or 'apk' -- the Linux VM we used to use, and its package manager. Look at the updated slides to see how Alpine-specific commands translate to Debian._
