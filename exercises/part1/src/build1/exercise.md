# Debugging exercise

Clone the repository `git@github.com:cs-uob/COMS10012` if you have not done so already and open the folder `code/debugging`.

There is a program `stackcalc.c` that attempts to implement the specification in `stackcalc.txt` for a RPN calculator, but it does not work correctly. For example, `1 2 +` should produce `3.0000` but produces `Error, operator on empty stack`. (Read the notes in the text file about how to compile the program with the required library.)

Your exercise is to debug and fix the program, making as few changes to the general structure as possible (so don't just rewrite the whole thing from scratch).
