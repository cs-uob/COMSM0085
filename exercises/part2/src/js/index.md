## Readings

### Essential

* [MDN: Working with JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON)
* [MDN: Manipulating documents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents)
* [MDN: Asynchronous JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/)
* [MDN: Fetching data from the server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data) (skip the section on `XMLHttpRequest`)

### Further

* [MDN: Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)
* [MDN: Document Object Model (DOM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) (see guides on the left)
* [Wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat), a famous [lightning
  talk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) by Gary Bernhardt (2012).

### Advanced

The following references go significantly beyond the curriculum.

* [MDN: Inheritance and the prototype chain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain). This is a guide to the protoyping-style object-orientation of JavaScript.
* [MDN: The event loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/EventLoop). This explains the concurrency model of JavaScript, as well as the way asynchronous code and promises arehandled.
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, JS edition](https://sourceacademy.org/sicpjs/) (2022). This is a classic programming book that has been recently rewritten in JavaScript.
* Boris Cherny, "[Programming TypeScript](https://bris.on.worldcat.org/oclc/1099253345)" (2019). This is a book-length introduction to TypeScript, a typed extension to JavaScript which is also supported by React.
