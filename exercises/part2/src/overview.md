# Overview

This page contains the exercises for Part 2 (the last 5 weeks) of COMSM0085 Software Tools.
As with Part 1, each week usually contains two workbooks -- sets of exercises which are supported
by videos to watch, or by set reading materials (more prominent in this part of
the unit). The exercises will require you to do some work within your Linux
VM in Vagrant, which we'll be supporting in the labs, but which you should
attempt before the lab to get the most out of the unit.

Part 2 focuses on web technologies. The Web is one of the largest software
ecosystems ever built, and a lot of programmers will either work on web
technologies or make use of them to present their other work. We'll be covering
the basics: how to write webpages, style them using CSS, make them interactive
using Javascript. Then we'll look at ways to treat websites and webpages as
parseable resources, and conclude by looking at the kinds of encryption needed
in common web transactions.
