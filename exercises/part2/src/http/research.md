# HTTP/URL research exercises

Research online what the following are and what they do:

  - The _fragment_ part of an URL.
  - The `Accept` header sent by the HTTP client.
  - The `User-agent` header sent by the HTTP client. What does your browser send?
  - How do you encode a path that contains a space in an URL? (The link to the slides PDF for the first video called "The internet" for this week contains an example. If you hover over the link, it will display the target filename as `The internet.pdf`, but how is it written in the HTML file?) Which other characters are "special" and need to be treated this way in paths?
  - Which web server is the University of Bristol using for `www.bristol.ac.uk`, according to the headers? Read up online on this server and the organisation of the same name that maintains it.
