# Exploring HTTP

## Before you start

To avoid an annoying problem, before we run our own server we are going to check that no-one else is already using the TCP port we want.

Run the command 

```
wget localhost:8000
```

on the machine where you want to run the _server_. It should time out after a couple of seconds (or instantly) with "failed" and some error message.

If it succeeds (shows "Connected" or "200 OK" anywhere), then someone or something else is using port 8000.

Next, run

    netstat -tan
    
and check that there is no line with the value "8000" under Local Address and a state of LISTEN or ESTABLISHED. If you get a lot of lines, `netstat -tan | grep 8000` will help. It does not matter if 8000 appears in the Foreign Address column, but there must be no-one using port 8000 under Local Address.

`netstat` should work on every OS including Windows (Microsoft has written their own version), but `wget` doesn't exist by default on Windows machines although it can be downloaded for free.

If either `wget` or `netstat` suggests port 8000 is in use,

  - If you are on a lab machine, it could be that another student is using port 8000 (maybe they are logged in via SSH).
  - You might have other software (such as a web development package) already using that port.

You can try port numbers 8001, 8002 etc until you get one that is definitely not being used and then replace 8000 with that in all further exercises today, or (on your own machine) you can stop whatever program is using the port first.

Note: if you have vagrant running and set up as described on the last page, and you run `wget localhost:8000` on your own machine (not the VM), then vagrant will be using port 8000 and `wget` might block waiting for a reply. This is the correct behaviour, and this is why I asked you to run `wget` on the machine where you want to run your _server_, not the _client_. If you want to do the following exercises with both server and client on your own machine, then you need to stop the vagrant VM first or remove the 8000 line from your vagrantfile.

## A basic HTTP server and client

Open a terminal on the machine where you want to run the server, and download the file [http-response](../resources/http-response) to the folder where your terminal is open (for example with `wget`). Then run the command

```
nc -l -p 8000 < http-response
```

This calls the tool `nc` ("network cat") and tells it to listen on TCP port 8000 (`-l -p 8000`), e.g. to run a server there. When a client connects, `nc` will by default read from its standard input and write this to the client, so we use a shell redirect to make it read from a file instead. The file contains some standard HTTP:

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-type: text/plain
    Content-length: 18
    Connection: close

    Hello over HTTP!


(If you want to type this out yourself or copy-paste, you **must** save the file with CRLF line endings and put two newlines after the hello message.)

`nc` will block until you connect a client. Open another terminal on the machine you want to run your client and run

    wget -q -S -O - localhost:8000

You have now made a HTTP connection from the wget client to the nc server. The server terminal should print out the HTTP request it got from the client (this is built into wget) and the client should print out the response from the server (which comes from the file).

## Connecting with a web browser

Run `nc -l -p 8000 < http-response` again on your server machine (kill the old one with `Control+C` first if it hasn't terminated already).

Open a web browser on your client machine (e.g. your own PC/laptop, or a lab machine). If you're using chrome/edge or firefox, open the debug tools (`F12`) and go to the network tab before you open the page.

Navigate to `localhost:8000`. You should see the line "Hello over HTTP!" and `nc` will print the HTTP request from your browser. You can then close it with `Control+C` if it doesn't terminate by itself. In your browser's debug tools, on the network tab you should see a file `localhost`, click this and then select _Headers_ in the details that appear.

This details page shows you the HTTP request details, including the response code (`200 OK` in this case) and all the headers sent in both directions. This screen is one of the first places you should look at when something web-based that you've coded is not working correctly or at all, as HTTP is normally the lowest layer you need to care about.

In particular, the `Content-type` header is a common source of mistakes: if you want to serve e.g. a script or a stylesheet but you don't set the correct type header, your browser may download the file just fine but won't do anything with it. Similarly, whether you send `text/plain` or `text/html` determines whether the browser will interpret a file you navigate to as HTML or not.

## A web server in C

On your server machine, clone the repository `https://github.com/emikulic/darkhttpd` which contains a single-file web server in just under 3000 lines of C. You do not need to understand this code, and in 2nd year Computer Systems A you will be able to write a web server in around 10 lines of golang instead and understand the concurrency principles behind it.

Compile the program either with `make` or simply `gcc darkhttpd.c -o darkhttpd`. Its job is to serve files within a folder, so make a subfolder called `web` and then run it with `./darkhttpd web --port 8000`. You can stop it again at the end of the exercise with `Control+C`.

You can now experiment with the following:

  - Create some files (plain text, HTML, image etc.) in `web/`.
  - Access them from your browser with `localhost:8000/FILENAME`, for example `web/hello.txt` would become `localhost:8000/hello.txt`.
  - Observe the HTTP headers in your browser's developer tools, and the server logs printed in the server terminal.

This particular server is written so that if you try and access a folder instead of a file, for example just `localhost:8000` which has the implicit path `/` which maps to the `web` folder, then it shows a list of files in this folder as clickable links.

Pay particular attention to how the `Content-type` header is sent depending on the file extension. From the browser's point of view, that header is what counts: if you send a file with `.html` extension but set `Content-type: text/plain`, the browser would not interpret it as HTML. This makes it possible to serve URLs with no "extension" at all like `/students` for a database application, and still have the browser understand what to do.

From the server's point of view, this server (like most other servers that simply serve files from a folder) has chosen to use a file's extension to determine what `Content-type` to send; this is implemented in the `default_extension_map` starting at line 320 of the source file.

You can try this out for yourself if you want: make a HTML file called `one.html5` in the web directory and access it with the browser. (`.html5` is not an official extension, it's something I just made up. The correct one to use for proper websites is `.html`.) The server won't send a `Content-type` header at all, since it doesn't know this extension, so the browser will either display it as a plain text file or download the file instead of showing it.

Edit the map in the source file and change the entry for `text/html` to read `" html htm html5"`, keeping the space at the start of the string. Recompile the server.

Rename the file to `two.html5` (I'll explain why in a second) and restart the server and try and open the file in the browser. This time, the file will display as a HTML page.

Why did you have to rename the file? Because the browser will otherwise try and be clever if it thinks you're trying to access a file that you've just downloaded already. The server sends a `Last-modified` header, and if the browser notices you're asking for a file you have just downloaded, with the same timestamp as the HTTP header indicates, then your browser might ignore the rest of the request and not see that another header has changed - I get this behaviour on Edge/Win10. Changing the file name forces the browser to look again as it thinks it's a different file now. Deleting the downloaded file, or editing the file on the server, would both have the same effect.

There is a moral here: if you're doing web development, and you are trying to find out why a change you made isn't showing in the browser (even if you refresh the page), it might be a cache problem. On the network tab of the developer tools window, there should be a checkbox to "disable cache" which you might want to turn on in this case and reload the page again, to exclude the cache as the possible source of the problem.
